      <h1>What is Atheism?</h1>
      <!-- A heading element, which defines a heading for the section. -->

        <!-- A summary element, which defines a summary or title for the details section. -->
        <p>There is no empirical evidence to support the existence of gods or deities. While many people claim to have had religious experiences, these experiences can be explained by natural causes and are not evidence of the supernatural.</p>

                <summary>The Problem of Evil</summary>
                <p>If an all-powerful, all-knowing, and all-good god exists, why is there evil and suffering in the world? This is a classic challenge to the existence of God and has been debated by philosophers and theologians for centuries.</p>

                <summary>The Argument from Inconsistency</summary>
                <p>Many religious beliefs are inconsistent with each other, and with scientific facts. For example, the Bible says that the Earth was created in six days, but scientific evidence shows that the Earth is billions of years old.</p>
